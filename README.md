To classify whether food in the picture is a hotdog or not. Based on the app [seefood in HBO's Silicon Valley ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIci3C4JkL0). To make this I used a pre-trained <b>Densenet121</b> model and applied transfer learning with the help of GPUs in cloud to fine tune the model to the hot-dogs dataset. This was made using <b>PyTorch</b> with <b>Python</b></p>

## Model 
* Classifier built upon a densenet121 model using transfer learning using PyTorch. 
* [Dataset , Hot Dog - Not Hot Dog](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/hot-dog-not-hot-dog)
* The model gave a accuracy of 87%.
